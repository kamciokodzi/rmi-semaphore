# RMI Semaphore

## Setup

First of all make sure to have installed `rmiregistry` command together with javac.

```
brew install javac
```

## Compilation

To run project first you had to compile all files by using script:
```
sh compile.sh
```

## Run
To run server you had to first start `rmiregistry` by typing:
```
rmiregistry &
```

Then in the same terminal start Server and Clients in different terminals.


## Explanation
Clients try to take some units from semaphore by a value generated by random.

Server uses built in Java synchronized mechanism of `wait` and `notify` - in this case `notifyAll`. Thanks to this synchronization we can determine and implement easily logic
for entering and leaving critical section.

Interface is a middleware between Server and Client so they can understand each other by
sharing implementation of P and V. P to take semaphore and V to leave.
